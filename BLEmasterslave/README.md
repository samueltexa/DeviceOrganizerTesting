BLE Master-Slave Application Project
This repository contains a Java implementation of a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Master-Slave application. This application demonstrates the communication between a master device and one or multiple slave devices using Bluetooth Low Energy technology.
Primary purpose to facilitate positioning of mobile beacons with dynamic switching between scanning and advertising 

## Features

- **Master-Slave Communication**: Demonstrates bidirectional communication between a master and slave device.
- **Java Implementation**: Implemented in Java for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to support multiple slave devices.
- **Simple Interface**: Provides a straightforward interface for understanding and modifying the BLE communication.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and concepts.
- BLE-compatible devices for testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with the BLE Master-Slave application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samueltexa/BLEmasterslave.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository**:
    ```bash
    cd BLE-Master-Slave
    ```

3. **Compile the Java Files**:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:

5. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: The application provides prompts and messages for guiding through the process of establishing the BLE connection.

## Usage

- Modify `Scanner.java` and 'Advertiser.java' as needed to suit your specific BLE application requirements.
- Ensure that both master and slave devices are Bluetooth Low Energy compatible.
- Debug and troubleshoot as necessary by analyzing the console outputs.
